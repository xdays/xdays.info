Managing your day-to-day life is not an easy job to do. There are so
many things to concern for - housekeeping, shopping, children... And
what about cousin's birthday you always forget or important phone
numbers? Undoubtedly your working place is covered with dusty yellow (or
blue, or pink) sticky notes. If so - PNotes is right for you. Throw the
physical stickies away and replace them with virtual ones on your
desktop.

PNotes (Pinned Notes or Portable Notes, use what you prefer) is written
entirely in C and Windows API (with [Pelles C for Windows
IDE](http://www.christian-heffner.de/)) - so it is fast and
light-weight.

-   **Ease of use** - no installation, just unpack the downloaded
    archive to any location and run PNotes.exe.
-   **Fully adjustable** - you set the default fonts, colors and
    dimensions of notes.
-   **Individual note adjusting** - every note can have its own
    settings, like fonts, colors etc.
-   **Rich text formatting** - any portion of note's text can be
    formatted separately.
-   **Password protection** - prevents unauthorized access to program.
-   **Encryption** - allows you to store notes as encrypted files, so
    even in case of loosing your USB stick nobody could read them.
-   **Backing up** - the notes could be backed up before saving - with
    any reasonable levels of copies - and quickly restored at any
    moment.
-   **Transparency** - opacity level for notes may vary from completely
    opaque to absolutely transparent.
-   **Skins** - there is a variety
    of [skins](http://pnotes.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=2) for
    PNotes (some of them are just works of art) and, moreover, you can
    create your own if download PNSkinCreator - a small utility for
    creation PNotes skins.
-   **Docking** - you may dock notes to any side of screen (all together
    or each one separately) and get as a result a kind of panel.
-   **Scheduling** - it is possible to schedule each note to remind you
    about significant events by many different ways. Using this feature
    you may just hide notes and don't worry, you'll be notified in time.
-   **Overdue reminders** - have you set a number of reminders and
    turned your computer off or taken the program in whole to another
    computer? Never mind, next time the program will start it will check
    it's settings and inform you about any overdue reminder.
-   **Favorites** - add frequently used notes to favorites for easy and
    fast access.
-   **Searching** - you may perform the quick search in notes either by
    their contents, or by their titles.
-   **E-mailing** - contents of each note or number of notes as
    attachment may be sent by e-mail.
-   **Control Panel** - this is your central command post. All
    management is put into effect here.
-   **Grouping** - notes can be separated into different groups for easy
    management. You may freely create, modify or delete groups and
    change every note's belonging by single click or just
    drag\_and\_drop.
-   **Internationalization** - PNotes is fully Unicode supported and
    translated into
    many [languages](http://pnotes.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=3).
-   **Portability** - PNotes leaves no traces in Windows registry and
    can be started from any drive (fixed or flash) on any computer. Take
    your notes with you to any location.
-   **Other features** - of course there are many other unmentioned
    features in program, but I suggest you to discover them by yourself,
    these are delights of any new program, aren't they?
