什么是putty ?

维基：PuTTY is a free and open source terminal emulator application
which can act as a client for the SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw TCP
computing protocols and as a serial console client. The name "PuTTY" has
no definitive meaning[1], though 'tty' is the name for a terminal in the
Unix tradition, usually held to be short for teletype.  
支持ssh,telnet,rlogin等的终端程序，原来tty来自于teletype
