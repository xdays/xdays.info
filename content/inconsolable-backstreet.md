Slug: inconsolable-backstreet

I close the door 掩上房门  
Like so many times, so many times before 如同过去许多次一样  
Felt like a scene on the cutting room floor 仿佛剪辑室地板上的一幕影像  
When I let you walk away tonight 今夜我让你离开  
Without a word 沉默无语

I try to sleep, yeah 我想入眠  
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
想起卿卿我我的时刻，时间停滞  
A thousand more regrets unraveling 千万个后悔倾泻而出  
ohh If you were here right now, I swear 此时此刻你若在旁  
I'd tell you this 我一定会吐露真言

CHORUS:  
Baby I don't want to waste another day 宝贝我不愿错失良机  
Keeping it inside it's killing me 有口难言让我人渐憔悴  
Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you 因为你是我所有的希冀  
I'm wishing I could find the words to say 穷尽辞藻无以表达心意  
Baby I would tell you every time you leave 宝贝听我说
每次看着你远去的背影  
I'm inconsolable 我心如刀割

I climb the walls 我在爱海中挣扎  
I can see the edge but I can't take the fall, no.我看到爱的尽头
但是我无法承受失败，无法承受  
I've memorized the number 你的号码我铭记于心  
So why can't I make the call? 为何我不曾打过电话？  
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me
或许是因为我知道你我终会共结连理  
In the possibility 或许真会

CHORUS:  
Baby I don't want to waste another day 宝贝我不愿错失良机  
Keeping it inside it's killing me 有口难言让我人渐憔悴  
Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you 因为你是我所有的希冀  
I'm wishing I could find the words to say 穷尽辞藻无以表达心意  
Baby I would tell you every time you leave 宝贝听我说
每次看着你远去的背影  
I'm inconsolable 我心如刀割

I don't want to be like this 分手并非我愿  
I just want to let you know 仅此表白心迹  
Everything that I'm holding 一旦拥有  
Is everything I can't let go, can't let go. 绝不放手，绝不放手

CHORUS:  
Baby I don't want to waste another day 宝贝我不愿错失良机  
Keeping it inside it's killing me 有口难言让我人渐憔悴  
Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you 因为你是我所有的希冀  
I'm wishing I could find the words to say 穷尽辞藻无以表达心意  
Baby I would tell you every time you leave 宝贝听我说
每次看着你远去的背影  
I'm inconsolable 我心如刀割，喔，不

Don't you know it baby 宝贝 难道你不明白  
I don't want to waste another day 我不愿错失良机  
I'm wishing I could find the words to say 穷尽辞藻，无以表达心意  
Baby I would tell you every time you leave
宝贝听我说，每次看你远去的背影  
I'm inconsolable 我心如刀割  
.......我痛不欲生
